# Applied Software Enginnering - SIT725

## Task 4.2P

### Description

In this task, we learned how to create a small database-driven application using MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js. The application connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose and defines a schema for tasks with required fields such as title and description. We implemented create and delete operations via API endpoints, allowing tasks to be created, read, and deleted. The integration of the database ensures persistent storage of tasks, enhancing the application's functionality and reliability.

### Library and Framework used:

```
MongoDB
Node.js
Materialize CSS
jQuery
Javascript
SCSS
```
