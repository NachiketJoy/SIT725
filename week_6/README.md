# Applied Software Enginnering - SIT725

## Task 6.2D

### Description

In this task, we focused on testing the API endpoints of a web application to ensure the correctness and reliability of its functionality. Mocha and Chai were used for writing and running unit tests, verifying that the API correctly handles tasks such as creating, retrieving, and deleting data.

By implementing automated tests for the API, we ensured that the endpoints work as expected under different conditions, including handling missing data. These tests help identify potential issues or bugs early in the development process, improving the overall quality and robustness of the software.

### Library and Framework used:

```
Node.js
Express
MongoDB
Mongoose
Mocha
Chai
Chai-HTTP
```
